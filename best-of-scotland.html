                    Welcome to Edinburgh <br><br>

                    Get lost in the narrow lanes of Edinburgh – the Scottish capital with a mystical air that combines ancient heritage with the verve of a modern city. Spend your day at leisure delving into its rich history and embracing the warm culture of the Scots, before joining your travel companions and Travel Director for a light meal and drinks. <br><br>
                 
                
                   <h2 class="daysaboba">Day 2</h2> <br>
                   Discover Enchanting Edinburgh <br><br>

                    Join your Local Specialist this morning for an intriguing sightseeing tour of the city. Ascend Castle Rock and visit Edinburgh Castle, which watches over the surrounding city from its elevated vantage point. Stroll through the Old Town along the Royal Mile and see the stunning Palace of Holyroodhouse before enjoying time at leisure to soak up the city's festive atmosphere. 






                   <h2 class="daysaboba">Day 3</h2> <br>

                   Venture into the Scottish Highlands <br><br>

                   Tread in the footsteps of the world's golfing greats and head to St. Andrews en route to the glorious Scottish Highlands. A scenic drive takes us north and across the Firth of Tay, past the city of Dundee to Pitlochry. After lunch, enjoy some free time to explore its riverside setting or join an Optional Experience to Blair Castle, the ancestral home of the Clan Murray. Our day in beautiful surrounds comes to an end with a cozy dinner at our hotel located within the Cairngorms National Park in the Scottish Highlands.
                   <h2 class="daysaboba">Day 4</h2> <br>
                   Explore Culloden, Loch Ness and the Isle of Skye <br><br>

                   Continue your journey to the tragic battlefield of Culloden. Pay tribute to the brave men who lost their lives in the Jacobite Uprising, then travel past Scotland's infamous Loch Ness. Join a MAKE TRAVEL MATTER® Experience at the Dundreggan Rewilding Center, to learn about the preservation of the fragile Caledonian pine forest and rare animal species. The solitary beauty of Eilean Donan Castle will leave you speechless before you continue to the coast and cross to the Isle of Skye. Heather-clad peaks provide a stunning backdrop for our scenic drive across the Sleat Peninsula. Board your ferry in Armadale and cross to Mallaig, back on the mainland.
                   <h2 class="daysaboba">Day 5</h2> <br>
                   Journey to Thriving Glasgow <br><br>

                   Our first stop today sees us commemorate World War II history at the Commando Memorial near Fort William, from which we admire spectacular views of Britain's highest peak – Ben Nevis. We journey through the volcanic ruins and precipitous mountains that lie just beyond Glencoe to see the 'Glen of Weeping'. Here we remember the MacDonald clansmen who were massacred in 1692. Continuing towards the River Clyde, we arrive at our final stop for the day – Glasgow.    
                
                   <h2 class="daysaboba">Day 6</h2> <br>
                   Walk the Walls of Stirling Castle <br><br>

                   Madainn mhath! While your Gaelic may be a little rusty, your orientation tour around this edgy city will be anything but. Begin your day seeing Glasgow's iconic sights. Enjoy views of the Necropolis, the regal George Square and River Clyde, for over 200 years the center of shipbuilding. Later, we Dive Into Culture at a whiskey distillery and enjoy a wee dram. Continue to Stirling, to see its hilltop fortress, which stands as a symbol of national pride. Stirling Castle was once the seat of Scottish kings and queens, including Mary, Queen of Scots. View the Wallace Monument from the castle walls, paying tribute to the Scottish hero who fought for Scotland's independence. After we join the Wood family at their 15th-century farm on the shores of Loch Ard to Connect With Locals over a home-cooked Be My Guest Farewell Dinner, amidst tales of Rob Roy and a few foot-tapping ceilidh tunes.
                   <h2 class="daysaboba">Day 7</h2> <br>
                
                   Farewell Glasgow <br><br>
