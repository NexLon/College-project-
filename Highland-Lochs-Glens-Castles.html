                    From Greenock on our Highland Lochs, Glens and Castles shore excursion we’ll cross the River Clyde where your driver guide will point out Dumbarton Castle. William Wallace was betrayed in 1305 by Sir John Menteith who imprisoned Wallace at Dumbarton Castle before handing him over to the English.  <br><br>            
                
                    Our route will take us along the western side of Loch Lomond and around the head of Loch Long. From there we climb the steep rocky mountain pass to the ‘Rest and be Thankful’. The name comes from the words etched on a stone by soldiers who built the original military road in 1753.  <br><br>

                    At Inveraray you’ll have time to explore the majestic Inveraray Castle and its spectacular gardens. A classic example of an 18th century planned town that was built by the 3rd Duke of Argyll, chief of the powerful Clan Campbell. With its distinctive, white-washed buildings, the town is a magnificent piece of Scottish Georgian architecture.  <br><br>

                    Our small group tour will travel to the imposing Kilchurn Castle, which stands at the head of Loch Awe amid a backdrop of soaring mountains where we’ll capture some photos of this mid-15th century castle.  <br><br>

                    We’ll stop for a light bite and some refreshments at a traditional Scottish pub. For over 317 years the Drovers Inn has welcomed the great and good including the infamous outlaw, Rob Roy MacGregor. Said to be haunted, there are many tales and sightings of ghouls and ghosts wandering around its creaking corridors. <br><br>

                    Our last stop of the day is on the bonnie banks of Loch Lomond at the picturesque Highland village of Luss. You’ll have some time to have wander around the village. From Luss we return you to your cruise ship where your Highland Lochs, Glens & Castles tour will end.  <br><br>
