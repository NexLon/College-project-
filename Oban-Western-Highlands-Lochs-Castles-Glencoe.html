                    Our small group tour passes dramatic Dumbarton Rock and its castle perched atop that stands guard over the River Clyde. Travelling along the west side of Loch Lomond your driver-guide will point out Ben Lomond, Scotland’s most southerly Munro.      <br><br>            
                
                    We’ll take a short break to enjoy the stunning views at the ‘Rest and be Thankful’. The name comes from travellers of old, who would stop, rest, and be thankful for reaching the top of this steep climb.  <br><br>

                    A short hop and we arrive at the Highland town of Inveraray. Established in 1745 by the 3rd Duke of Argyll, chief of the powerful Clan Campbell, you can explore the town or take an optional visit to Inveraray castle.  <br><br>

                    We’ll pause at the imposing mid-15th century Kilchurn Castle, which stands at the head of Loch Awe amid a backdrop of soaring mountains.  <br><br>

                    Renowned for the variety and quality of its seafood, Oban is where we’ll stop for lunch. It’s a steep climb up to McCaig’s Tower but for your effort you will be rewarded with stunning panoramic views over Oban Bay.  <br><br>

                    Our journey continues along the rugged west coast, passing Loch Creran to Castle Stalker. Situated on its own little islet in Loch Laich, we’ll stop here to capture some photos.  <br><br>

                    After the beauty of Argyll’s stretching sea lochs we arrive in Glencoe, Scotland’s most famous glen. It’s also known as the ‘Weeping Glen’ due to the terrible events that took place here in 1692.  <br><br>

                    We’ll stop at a traditional Scottish Highland pub for early evening refreshments. The Drovers Inn has welcomed weary travellers for over 300 years including infamous outlaw Rob Roy MacGregor.  <br><br>

                    From here we return to Glasgow where your Oban, Western Highlands, Lochs Castles & Glencoe tour ends.  <br><br>
