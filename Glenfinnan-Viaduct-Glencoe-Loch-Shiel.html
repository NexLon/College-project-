                    From Edinburgh we’ll pass Stirling Castle, historically and architecturally one of Scotland’s most important castles. The Highland town of Callander is where we’ll make our first stop of the day for morning refreshments. <br><br>
                        
                    You’ll see shimmering lochs and magnificent mountain scenery as we make our way through wild Rannoch Moor to spectacular Glencoe. Filming for the James Bond movie Skyfall took place on this stretch of road, so have your camera ready as we follow 007’s trail. <br><br>
                    
                    We’ll have time to explore this stunning area which was also used as backdrop scenery in several Harry Potter films. One of Scotland’s darkest periods in Scottish history, the Glencoe massacre, took place at Glencoe in 1692. 38 men, women and children of the clan MacDonald were murdered by government forces as they slept. <br><br>

                    At the Glencoe Turf House, you ‘ll be able to see what life must have been like for the 500-600 strong community that lived here in 17th century Glencoe. <br><br>

                    At Glenfinnan you’ll have ample time to walk up to the best viewpoints to see the Jacobite Steam train (the Hogwarts Express) cross over the famous Glenfinnan Viaduct. You’ll also get stunning views of Loch Shiel and the Glenfinnan Monument. <br><br>
                 
                    Glenfinnan isn’t only famous for its Harry Potter connection, Bonnie Prince Charlie first raised the Jacobite Standard in his fabled but ultimately doomed attempt to re-take the thrones of Scotland, England & Ireland. Learn more at the excellent exhibition in the visitor centre and be sure to visit the monument on the shores of Loch Shiel that marks the spot. <br><br>

                    Walk down to the shores of Loch Shiel (Hogwarts Lake aka the Black Lake), we are certain that you’ll be safe from any lurking Grindylows. <br><br>

                    Our return to Edinburgh will take us through Fort William and if we are lucky enough, we might see the top of Ben Nevis, Britain’s highest mountain. <br><br>

                    Our final stop is at Pitlochry where we’ll have a short break before we return you to Edinburgh where your Glenfinnan Viaduct, Glencoe & Loch Shiel tour will end. <br><br>
