                Just 40 minutes from Glasgow and you’ll be enjoying a morning coffee on the bonnie banks of Loch Lomond. Travelling deeper into the Highlands we’ll pass desolate Rannoch Moor, one of Europe’s last remaining wildernesses. <br><br>
                        
                The scenery just keeps getting better especially as we near Glencoe. In view of its history and stunning beauty we’ll stop here to stretch our legs, take a deep breath and just take it all in! This was also the setting to one of the most shameful periods in Scottish history – the Glencoe Massacre. <br><br>
                    
                We’re now following the Great Glen, a natural fault-line that divides Scotland from coast to coast. It was in 1822 when one of the world’s great waterways, the Caledonian Canal was opened. It linked the Great Glen’s loch so that ships could have safe passage across the country therefore avoiding the dangerous waters around the north coast. <br><br>

                 One of these lochs is the legendary Loch Ness and at its southern tip lies the historic hamlet of Fort Augustus. We’ll stop here for around two hours giving you time to enjoy some lunch. You can also search for the mythical Loch Ness monster with the option to purchase a one-hour Loch Ness cruise. <br><br>

                Our return journey to Glasgow will see us travel through the Cairngorms National Park and alongside Loch Laggan to Pitlochry for our final break of the day. <br><br>
                
                Continuing south through picturesque Perthshire, we’ll pass Stirling Castle and the National Wallace Monument. The monument overlooks the site of the battle of Stirling Bridge where Scots patriot William Wallace defeated a much larger, advancing English army in 1297. Shortly after, our Loch Ness tour from Glasgow ends. <br><br>
