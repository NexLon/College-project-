                <p><h2 class="daysaboba">Day 1</h2> <br>
                    
                    Departing from Glasgow our first port of call is pretty Luss where quaint cottages stretch down to the bonnie banks of Loch Lomond. We’ll stop at the iconic viewpoint the ‘Rest and Be Thankful’ so named by the words etched on stone by weary soldiers who built the military road in 1750. <br><br>
                   
                    We’ll stop for lunch at Inveraray on Loch Fyne. Scotland’s first planned town, it was built in 1745 by the 3rd Duke of Argyll, chief of the powerful Clan Campbell. You can stroll around the town or explore Inveraray Castle and its resplendent gardens, where the Duke of Argyll still lives today. <br><br>

                    From Oban,‘The Gateway to the Isles’ we’ll take the ferry to the Isle of Mull and head for Tobermory, probably the most photographed town in Scotland with its multi-coloured houses overlooking the harbour. <br><br>
                   
                   
                 
                
                   <h2 class="daysaboba">Day 2</h2> <br>
                   From Fionnphort a small passenger ferry guides us over azure waters to the tiny sacred island of Iona. St Columba and his companions came from Ireland to establish a monastery here in 563 AD and it’s been a place of Christian worship and international pilgrimage ever since. <br><br>

                    You can visit Iona Abbey and stand on Torr an Aba, the little hill above where St Columba is thought to have had his writing hut. Explore St Oran’s Chapel and Reilig Òdhrain, the graveyard where 48 ancient kings of Scotland, including Macbeth, are said to be buried. <br><br>

                    There’s an option to take boat trip to Fingal’s Cave on uninhabited Staffa, which includes an hour’s visit. The best time to see puffins is from early May to early August. You might also see Dolphins and porpoises playing in the water, and if you are lucky enough you may see minke and fin whales or even the elusive basking shark whose fin breaks the water as it feeds. <br><br>

                    Fingal’s Cave is a geological wonder with its hexagonal basalt rock columns formed millions of years ago by volcanic eruptions. Its evocative acoustics inspired Mendelssohn to compose his Hebrides Overture (Fingal’s Cave) after he visited in 1829. <br><br>






                   <h2 class="daysaboba">Day 3</h2> <br>

                   There are signs of an ancient fort and a Highland clearance village near to the Kilmore Standing stones. White-tailed eagles are regularly spotted at Calgary Bay whose glistening white sand rivals any Caribbean destination. <br><br>

                    Ulva, a truly unspoilt isle with pristine blue waters rolling onto white shell beaches and woods carpeted in billiard green moss is an island haven for walkers and wildlife enthusiasts that’s definitely off the beaten track. <br><br>

                    There’s a museum and heritage centre housed in the thatched ‘Sheila’s Cottage’.and be sure to visit the Boathouse for some tasty home-baking. Back in Tobermory you might enjoy its quaint shops, traditional Scottish pubs or a dram of single malt whisky at Tobermory Distillery. <br><br>
   
                   <h2 class="daysaboba">Day 4</h2> <br>

                   Our first ferry today takes us over the Sound of Mull to Lochaline, this spectacular peninsula was shaped thousands of years ago by volcanoes and ice. An hour later we’ll take the Corran Ferry en route to Glencoe, Scotland’s most famous glen. <br><br>

                    From Glencoe we’ll pass desolate Rannoch Moor, one of Europe’s last great wildernesses, and head into picturesque Killin. You’ll want to pose for selfies at the village’s dramatic rapids, the Falls of Dochart. <br><br>

                    Doune Castle dates back to around the 14th century and has starred in Outlander as Castle Leoch, Game of Thrones as Winterfell and in the cult comedy Monty Python as Swamp Castle, Castle Anthrax and Camelot. <br><br>

                    Our return to Glasgow is via Edinburgh and the Kelpies, the world’s largest equine sculptures. Standing over 30 metres high, these two giant steel horse heads are a monument to Scotland’s horse-powered industrial heritage. <br><br>
