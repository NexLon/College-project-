                <p><h2 class="daysaboba">Day 1</h2> <br>
                    

                    As we travel across the Forth Road Bridge you’ll be able to see one of Scotland’s most iconic landmarks, the Forth Bridge. Built in 1890, this impressive bridge is a UNESCO World Heritage site and is still one of the world’s longest cantilever bridges. <br><br>
                        
                    Our first stop of the day is in the historic town of Dunkeld, it’s history dating from around 730AD. Following the accession of King William and Queen Mary to the throne in 1689, there were a series of Jacobite risings. After their defeat at the battle of Killiecrankie government forces retreated to Dunkeld. A month later only three houses in the village remained intact after the Jacobites attacked the remaining forces. <br><br>
                    
                    Continuing the Jacobite theme we’ll make our way to Ruthven Barracks. This was one of four barracks built in the highlands following the Jacobite rising of 1715. After the battle of Culloden the Jacobites set fire to the barracks and what you see today is how they left it. We’ll have our lunch stop in the Rothiemurchus estate which lies in the heart of the Cairngorms National Park. <br><br>

                    Our final stop of the day will be at the village of Dores on the shores of Loch Ness. This is where legendary Nessie hunter Steve Feltham has been hunting the Loch Ness monster full time since 1991. We’ll have time for a refreshment in the wee cosy pub at Loch Ness before travelling to Inverness for our two night stay there. <br><br>
                 
                
                   <h2 class="daysaboba">Day 2</h2> <br>
                   An hours’ drive after leaving Inverness we arrive at Corrieshalloch Gorge. Glacial meltwater created this stunning gorge. Cross the Victorian suspension bridge and see the Falls of Measach plummet into one of Britain’s most spectacular gorges. <br><br>

                   On the north shore of Loch Assynt stands the ruins of Ardvreck Castle. This was the stronghold of the Clan MacLeod of Assynt. A short but enjoyable walk takes you to see the island where the ruins stand. <br><br>
                   
                   We’ll head to the small fishing village of Lochinver for lunch. Achmelvich beach is only a 10 minute drive from here. Stunning white sandy beaches with turquoise waters, this is the perfect place for a picnic if there weather is kind. <br><br>
                   
                   One of the best places in Scotland to see salmon leaping is at the Falls of Shin. Its a magnificent sight, some salmon make it on their first attempt whilst others have to leap again and again. The best time to spot the salmon is between April and September, although we have seen them as late as the end of October. <br><br>







                   <h2 class="daysaboba">Day 3</h2> <br>

                   Words cannot justify the views and scenery we’ll encounter today as we travel to the Isle of Skye. Our first stop will be at the Beinn Eighe National Nature Reserve. From here we’ll travel to the village of Shieldaig, surely one of the most picturesque villages in Scotland. <br><br>

                    We’ll take the stunning coastal road to Applecross. This is a slow winding road with magnificent scenery and views across to the isles of Raasay and Skye. You’ll have time for a wander around the village before we take the famous Bealach na Bà (pass of the cattle) road. <br><br>

                    This is the most well-known stretch of the North Coast 500 route. The twisting, single-track mountain road is one of the highest roads in the UK rising up to 626m (2,054ft) above sea level. It twists, loops, has hairpin bends and with a gradient of 7.2 percent making this one of Scotland’s most scenic and challenging roads. <br><br>

                    Before arriving on the Isle of Skye we’ll visit Eilean Donan Castle. Its possible you may recognise this castle as it adorns many paintings, photographs and calendars of Scotland. The Castle sits on its own little island where three great sea lochs meet. Its also an iconic film location where movies such as Highlander and James Bond’s The World is Not Enough featured. <br><br>
   
                   <h2 class="daysaboba">Day 4</h2> <br>

                   Skye is famous for fairies, beautiful landscapes, fishing villages, and old castles. At the foot of the Black Cuillin mountains lie the fairy pools. This magical place of outstanding beauty with its picturesque waterfalls and crystal clear blue pools is a must see when on Skye. You’ll have the opportunity to take a hike up to the pools. <br><br>

                    We’ll have time for lunch and to explore Portee, the capital and largest town on the island. Leaving Portree we’ll head north to the Trotternish Peninsula. On route we’ll visit the fairy glen, a delightful miniature landscape of grassy cone shaped hills with small ponds dotted all around. <br><br>

                    The beautiful scenery keeps going, and we’ll see amazing views at the Quiraing with interesting rock formations. We’ll stop at Kilt Rock before we reach the Old Man of Storr, where you’ll be able to take some photos of this famous landmark. <br><br>

                   <h2 class="daysaboba">Day 5</h2> <br>

                   We’ll look to leave Skye on the last manually operated turntable ferry in the world. Crossing the Kylerhea straits we often see wildlife such as seals, dolphins and sea eagles. This route takes us over the mountain pass where you can enjoy views over Loch Duich and the five sisters of Kintail. <br><br>

                    Our journey will take us through Fort William which sits in the shadow of Ben Nevis, Britain’s highest mountain before stopping in Glencoe. Visit the reconstructed turf house and see what life was like in 17th century Glencoe for the 500-600 strong community that lived here. <br><br>

                    Our last stop will be at the village of Luss which sits on the bonnie banks of Loch Lomond. You’ll have time to enjoy the Queen of all Scotland’s lochs before returning to Edinburgh via Glasgow. <br><br>
