                    From Edinburgh we’ll head over to the Kelpies where we’ll get some photos of these stunning monuments. These pieces of art are the largest equine sculptures in the world.  <br><br>            
                
                    Loch Lomond lies on the Highland Boundary Fault line that divides the Scottish Highlands from the Lowlands. At Balloch you can choose to take a one-hour cruise on Loch Lomond where you’ll enjoy stunning scenery with views of the magnificent Ben Lomond. Inchmurrin Island is the largest of Loch Lomond’s 33 islands and is home to the ancient ruins of Lennox Castle where Robert the Bruce sheltered before he became King of Scotland.  <br><br>

                    If you prefer to stay on dry land, there’s time to explore Balloch Castle Country Park, where you can visit the Fairy Glen, the Chinese Garden and enjoy superb views over Loch Lomond. <br><br>

                    We’ll have lunch within the National Park before travelling over the dramatic Dukes Pass into the Trossachs. The name ‘Trossachs’ comes from the Gaelic meaning ‘a Bristly Place’ and its forest covered mountains and shimmering highland lochs will take your breath away. This was also the stomping ground of Rob Roy MacGregor; you’ll hear tales from your driver guide about this Scottish folk hero.  <br><br>

                    As we travel through the Loch Lomond & Trossachs National Park lookout for our woolly, long-horned Highland cows, we call them hairy coos! <br><br>

                    You’ll have time to visit to Stirling Castle, one of the most important castles in Scottish history, great royal residence of the Stuart Kings and Mary Queen of Scots, who was crowned here in 1543, aged only nine months. With close associations to Robert the Bruce and Bonnie Prince Charlie, the castle overlooks the site of the battle of Stirling Bridge where another famous Scots hero, William Wallace of ‘Braveheart’ fame and his cry for freedom defeated a much larger English army in 1297.  <br><br>

                    From Stirling we’ll make our return to Edinburgh where your Loch Lomond, Stirling Castle & the Kelpies tour will end. <br><br>
